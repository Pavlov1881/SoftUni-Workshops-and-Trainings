# Crypto Trade
**Crypto Trade** is a multipage application with MVC architecture for my JS Back-End course final exam preparation. The back-end is created with Express.js. For database I'm using MongoDB and Mongoose. View engine is Express-Handlebars.

## Application Overview
The visitors can view the Home page and All Crypto catalog with available offers. They can also register with an email, username, and password, allowing them to create their offers for crypto trade and buy crypto (if the current user is not the owner of the crypto offer). Authors can edit or delete posts at any time.

**Guest (not logged in)**
The application should provide Guest (not logged in) users with the functionality to Login, Register, and view the Home page, All Crypto page, and the Details page.

**Users (logged in)**
    • View the Home page and all other pages with logged-in navigation
    • View All Crypto page
    • Create а new crypto offer [Create Offer]
    • Access crypto details page [Details]
    • Buy crypto (if the current user is not the owner of the offer)
    • Delete or Edit the offer depending on the user's authentication (only for the owner of the current offer for crypto)
